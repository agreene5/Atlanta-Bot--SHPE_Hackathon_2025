Wings at Jamal’s Buffalo Wings
Residents who lived in or attended school near the West End over the last two decades are likely familiar with the wing shack that sat in the parking lot across from what used to be the Georgia Dome. Now that Mercedes-Benz Stadium has changed the landscape, Jamal’s has changed locations to the edge of Westview Cemetery. But, the crispy fried, sauce-soaked wings have stayed exactly the same — delicious. Expect the savory flavor to literally shine through, especially on the honey bar-b-que and hot lemon pepper flavors. — Mike Jordan

Blackened grouper sandwich at Fishmonger
Nhan Le, Skip Engelbrecht, and chef Brad Forsblom struck gold with the opening of seafood market and cafe Fishmonger when it opened in Poncey-Highland in 2022, followed by a second location at Pratt Pullman District later that same year. Much of this success can be linked to the delicious blackened grouper sandwich. The delicate filet is dipped in nori butter and sprinkled with a blend of ten spices before hitting a hot skillet to crisp the skin. The spice blend features everything from Sichuan pepper, cumin, fennel, and black pepper, to cinnamon, cloves, coriander, and fresh onion bits. The fish is then topped with zesty Florida sauce, herb salad, and pickled peppers and served on a buttery toasted bun smeared with more nori butter. A third location of Fishmonger is open on Howell Mill Road.
