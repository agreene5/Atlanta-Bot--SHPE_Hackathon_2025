PROGRAMS
Entitlement & Competitive Grants

The Department of Grants and Community Development (DGCD) is the lead entity in preparing and implementing the City of Atlanta’s federal entitlement programs and competitively awarded grant programs including: Community Development Block Grant (CDBG); Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG); HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME); and Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) Program.

The Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program (Mod Rehab) is a unit-based rental subsidy program for low and moderately low-income individuals and families. While the Housing Authority administers the program, HUD provides rent subsidy payments to private and nonprofit property owners for rental units rehabilitated under this program. These subsidies provide both rental support to the family as well as funds to service the debt incurred by the property owner for the unit’s rehabilitation. Mod Rehab assistance is not transferable as it is not the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program. 

We do not have a Housing Choice Voucher program and do not issue nor accept applications for vouchers at any time. Atlanta Housing Authority administers housing vouchers. If you would like to apply for a housing voucher, currently have a voucher, or are considering portability transfer as an option, contact the Atlanta Housing Authority @ (404) 892-4700 to discuss.

Consolidated Plan
The Consolidated Plan (ConPlan)  is a five-year, strategic plan that serves as a framework for the City of Atlanta to identify its housing and community development needs, priorities, goals, and strategies. The plan guides the use of HUD funds received by the City.

The City of Atlanta is preparing its 5-year Consolidated Plan and Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice for 2025-2029. These reports are designed to help the City assess affordable housing and community development priorities with input from community members and stakeholders. The data-driven priorities then align and focus federal funding available to the City.

The City is seeking the input of citizens and will host public meetings. Also, it has launched a comprehensive community survey to gather information. Please see the flyer before for additional information on public meetings and the community survey.

Citizen’s Participation Plan
The Citizen Participation Plan (CPP) sets forth policies and procedures to provide for and encourage participation by the residents of Atlanta in the development of the City’s Con Plan and the associated AAP. The CPP also applies to any substantial amendments to the Con Plan or an AAP, the preparation of the CAPER which evaluates progress toward the Con Plan objectives, and the Fair Housing Study known as an Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice (AI) or any other successor study or report for the purpose of evaluating the City’s affirmative commitment to fair housing.

While the Department of Grants and Community Development (DGCD) does not provide CDBG, HOME, ESG and HOPWA funds directly to individuals, everyone in our community plays a vital role in providing input in developing the City’s:

On April 11, 1968, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which was meant as a follow-up to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The 1968 Act expanded on previous acts and prohibited discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of dwellings, and in other housing-related transactions, because of:

Race
Color
Religion
Sex (including gender identity and sexual orientation)
Familial status (children in the household under age 18)
National Origin
Disability (Including physical and mental disabilities and HIV/AIDS)
It also requires that all federal programs relating to housing and urban development be administered in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing. Title VIII of the Act is also known as the Fair Housing Act (of 1968).  The Fair Housing Act protects people from discrimination when they are renting or buying a home, getting a mortgage, seeking housing assistance, or engaging in other housing-related activities. Additional protections apply to federally-assisted housing.

Atlanta’s civil and human rights fair housing ordinance is found in Chapter 94 of the Atlanta Municipal Code as amended.

ATLANTA GA CODE PT. II, CHAP. 94.  The city’s ordinance prohibits discrimination against any person in Atlanta in employment and fair housing on the seven bases identified above, as well as, age, domestic relationship status, parental status, gender identity or sexual orientation.

The City of Atlanta has established a  Human Relations Commission (HRC), located in the Mayor’s Office of Constituent Services, to promote mutual respect and understanding within the city of Atlanta. The HRC investigates and hears complaints regarding discrimination, makes recommendations on how to resolve such complaints, and initiates activities in keeping with its mission.

To file a complaint, please download the Human Relations Commission Complaint Form. Forms are also available for completion on premise at Atlanta City Hall.

Completed complaint forms may be submitted in one of the following ways:

Email – Send to hrc@atlantaga.gov

The HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) provides formula grants to states and localities that communities use - often in partnership with local nonprofit groups - to fund a wide range of activities including building, buying, and/or rehabilitating affordable housing for rent or homeownership or providing direct rental assistance to low-income people. It is the largest Federal block grant to state and local governments designed exclusively to create affordable housing for low-income households.

The HOME Program, established under Title II (Home Investment Partnerships Act) of the National Affordable Housing Act of 1990, has several purposes, including:

To expand the supply of decent and affordable housing for low- and very low-income Americans - such housing includes existing rental housing made affordable through tenant-based assistance.
To strengthen the abilities of State and local governments and nonprofit organizations to design and implement strategies for providing decent, affordable housing.
To provide financial and technical assistance to participating jurisdictions, including developing model programs for developing affordable housing.
To create and strengthen partnerships among all government and the private sector levels, including for-profit and nonprofit organizations, to produce and/or manage affordable housing.
The program was designed to reinforce several important values and principles of community development:

HOME's flexibility empowers people and communities to design and implement strategies tailored to their own needs and priorities.

HOME's emphasis on consolidated planning expands and strengthens partnerships among all levels of government and the private sector in the development of affordable housing.
HOME's technical assistance activities and set-aside for qualified community-based nonprofit housing groups builds the capacity of these partners.
HOME's requirement that Participating Jurisdictions (PJs) match 25 cents of every dollar in program funds mobilizes community resources in support of affordable housing.
 HOME-assisted rental housing must comply with certain rent limitations. HOME rent limits are published each year by HUD. The program also establishes maximum per unit subsidy limits and homeownership value limits. Participating jurisdictions may choose among a broad range of eligible activities, using HOME funds to provide home purchase or rehabilitation financing assistance to eligible homeowners and new homebuyers; build or rehabilitate housing for rent or ownership; or for "other reasonable and necessary expenses related to the development of non-luxury housing," including site acquisition or improvement, demolition of dilapidated housing to make way for HOME-assisted development, and payment of relocation expenses. PJs may use HOME funds to provide tenant-based rental assistance contracts of up to 2 years if such activity is consistent with their Consolidated Plan and justified under local market conditions. This assistance may be renewed.

CHDO Certification
A Community Housing Development Organization (CHDO) is a private nonprofit, community-based organization that has staff with the capacity to develop affordable housing for the community it serves. The term CHDO refers to a special designation awarded by state and local governments to non-profit housing developers that meet federally defined requirements including but not limited to staff capacity, board composition, legal structure, and service history.  To qualify for designation as a CHDO, the organization must meet certain requirements pertaining to their legal status, organizational structure, and capacity and experience.

The City of Atlanta’s Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program (Mod Rehab) is a unit-based rental subsidy program for low and moderately low-income individuals and families. The Program provides rental subsidies to three (3) project-based facilities. Project-based simply means that all assistance provided remains with the property. It is non-transferable.

While the Housing Authority administers the program, HUD provides rent subsidy payments to private and nonprofit property owners for rental units rehabilitated under this program. These subsidies provide both rental support to the family as well as funds to service the debt incurred by the property owner for the unit’s rehabilitation. Mod Rehab assistance is not transferable as it is not the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program.

Participants in the Mod Rehab program will only receive rental assistance if they live in a Mod Rehab unit. If they move from a Mod Rehab unit, they will lose their assistance. Some Mod Rehab units are set-aside for the elderly, homeless, or disabled.


The City of Atlanta does not administer the Housing Choice Voucher program and will not accept applications for vouchers at any time. Atlanta Housing administers housing choice vouchers. If you would like to apply for a housing choice voucher, currently have a voucher, or are considering portability transfer as an option, contact Atlanta Housing @ (404) 892-4700 for more information.

 A few facts to remember: 

Participants in the Mod Rehab program will only receive rental assistance if they live in a Mod Rehab unit. If they move from a Mod Rehab unit, they will lose their assistance. Some Mod Rehab units are set-aside for the elderly, homeless, or disabled.

The City of Atlanta’s Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program provides rental subsidies to two (2) project-based facilities. Project-based simply means that all assistance provided remains with the property. It is non-transferable.

An environmental review is the process of reviewing a project and its potential environmental impacts to determine whether it meets federal, state, and local environmental standards. 

The environmental review process is required for all HUD-assisted projects to ensure that the proposed project does not negatively impact the surrounding environment and that the property site itself will not have an adverse environmental or health effect on end users. 

An environmental review must be performed before any funds, regardless of source, are committed to a project.

Admin dollars are cleared on the front end and does not require action by the recipient. However, below is an exception:

Federal funds pays for the recipient’s office space - move or secure additional space
The new office must be environmentally cleared prior to you signing a lease. 
All other activities, funded in part or whole with federal funds, require an individual environmental review prior to expending funds.

REQUEST FOR RELEASE OF FUNDS 

On or about November 21, 2023, the City of Atlanta’s Department of Grants and Community Development (DGCD) will submit a request to the HUD Atlanta Regional Office for the release of funds under the Housing Act of 1937, as amended, for the following project: Project: 2222 Wingate St. SW, Atlanta GA 30310  Purpose: DGCD is proposing to provide HOME funding for construction of a single family house on a vacant lot at the above address. . COVID-19 pandemic has exposed deep economic and health disparities and has disproportionately impacted low-income communities across metro Atlanta. In particular, low-income individuals have seen particularly large increases in housing insecurity before and during the pandemic. Exacerbating challenges for low and moderate-income individuals, there continues to be a shortage of affordable housing properties on the market. Recent research conducted by the National Low Income Housing Coalition reveals that households in the Atlanta MSA would need to make $19.83 an hour to afford a 2-bedroom home without paying more than 30% of income on housing. This equates to an annual income of over $40,000 per year or nearly $30,000 more than minimum wage. Eligible households and families with incomes at or less than 80% of the Area Median Income for the City of Atlanta will benefit from the proposed program. HUD’s 2022 HOME and Income Limits, as adjusted for family size, will be used to determine income eligibility. Purchasers will meet income eligibility and desire to own a home in one of the targets low- or moderate-income neighborhoods. Purchasers must complete a minimum of eight hours of homebuyer education from a HUD-approved provider prior to closing and must be able to secure first mortgage financing from a lender. Homebuyer subsidy (down payment assistance and closing costs) will be provided in the form of a soft-second mortgage that will be forgiven over the HOME period of affordability. Eligible purchasers will receive a minimum of $1,000; the actual amount offered will be based on the specific needs of the borrower. 

FINDING OF NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT

The City of Atlanta has determined that the project will have no significant impact on the human environment. Therefore, an Environmental Impact Statement under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) is not required. Additional project information is contained in the Environmental Review Record. The ERR will be made available to the public for review electronically. Please submit your request by email to gmenvironmentalreview@atlantaga.gov.

PUBLIC COMMENTS

REQUEST FOR RELEASE OF FUNDS

On or about November 21, 2023, the City of Atlanta’s Department of Grants and Community Development (DGCD) will submit a request to the HUD Atlanta Regional Office for the release of funds under the Housing Act of 1937, as amended, for the following project: Project: 4001 Blanton Ave. SW, Atlanta, GA 30331 Purpose: DGCD is proposing to provide HOME funding for construction of a single family house on a vacant lot at the above address. COVID-19 pandemic has exposed deep economic and health disparities and has disproportionately impacted low-income communities across metro Atlanta. In particular, low-income individuals have seen particularly large increases in housing insecurity before and during the pandemic. Exacerbating challenges for low and moderate-income individuals, there continues to be a shortage of affordable housing properties on the market. Recent research conducted by the National Low Income Housing Coalition reveals that households in the Atlanta MSA would need to make $19.83 an hour to afford a 2-bedroom home without paying more than 30% of income on housing. This equates to an annual income of over $40,000 per year or nearly $30,000 more than minimum wage. Eligible households and families with incomes at or less than 80% of the Area Median Income for the City of Atlanta will benefit from the proposed program. HUD’s 2022 HOME and Income Limits, as adjusted for family size, will be used to determine income eligibility. Purchasers will meet income eligibility and desire to own a home in one of the targets low- or moderate-income neighborhoods. Purchasers must complete a minimum of eight hours of homebuyer education from a HUD-approved provider prior to closing and must be able to secure first mortgage financing from a lender. Homebuyer subsidy (down payment assistance and closing costs) will be provided in the form of a soft-second mortgage that will be forgiven over the HOME period of affordability. Eligible purchasers will receive a minimum of $1,000; the actual amount offered will be based on the specific needs of the borrower.

FINDING OF NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT

The City of Atlanta has determined that the project will have no significant impact on the human environment. Therefore, an Environmental Impact Statement under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) is not required.

On July 23, 2020, the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson today announced https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_20_109 that the Department will ultimately terminate the Obama Administration’s Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) regulation issued in 2015.  Ben Carson has indicated that the Trump Administration has established programs like Opportunity Zones that drive billions of dollars of capital into underserved communities where affordable housing exists, but opportunity does not. Programs like this allow communities to focus more of their time working with Opportunity Zone partners to revitalize their communities so upward mobility, improved housing, and home ownership is within reach for more people.  

In addition, there is a brand-new rule, called Preserving Community and Neighborhood Choice located at https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/ENF/documents/6228-F-01%20Preserving%20Housing%20and %20Neighborhood%20Choice.pdf that defines fair housing broadly to mean housing that, among other attributes, is affordable, safe, decent, free of unlawful discrimination, and accessible under civil rights laws. It then defines “affirmatively furthering fair housing” to mean any action rationally related to promoting any of the above attributes of fair housing.

Persons who believe they have experienced housing discrimination may continue to file a complaint of discrimination using the following:
